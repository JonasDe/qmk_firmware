# Redox Specific install instructions

## Flashing redix on windows

### Prerequisites

1. Download this utility https://msys.qmk.fm/
2. Start the app (will be a CMD window)
3. Follow setup instruction (`qmk setup`)

### Flashing
With prerequisites we now have QMK CLI. Time to flash.
Flashing procedure is done by attaching USB cable to computer, and then taking a needle and press the reset button.
Make sure it's a DATA-enabled USB cable.

For Redox split keyboard, we may have to flash each side separately to set up master-slave relationship.

#### Option 1 - flash each split side separately

Split right
```
qmk flash -kb redox -km default -bl avrdude-split-right
```
Split left
```
qmk flash -kb redox -km default -bl avrdude-split-left
```

#### Option 2 - flash both sides with same bootloader

```
qmk flash -kb redox -km default -bl avrdude
```

6. This should be profit!
